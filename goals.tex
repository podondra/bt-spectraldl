\chap Goals

First goal of thesis' theoretical part is to introduce deep learning concepts
in context of astronomical data. Second goal is to analyze some preprocessing
algorithm and their application on astronomical spectra. Last goal of
theoretical part is to analyze available deep learning frameworks.

Pratical part of this thesis primarily aims to take the most suitable deep
learning framework and implement program for astronomical spectra
classification.
