\chap Machine Learning

Machine learning is subfield of computer science. Widely quoted formal
definition is provided in \cite[mitchell97]:
``{\em A computer program is said to learn from
experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure
P, if its preformance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with
experince E.}''

subfield of computer science
evolved from pattern recognition and computational learning theory
