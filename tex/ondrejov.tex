\chap Classifying Ondřejov Archive

This chapter discusses creation of spetral dataset from Ondřejov CCD700 archive.
Overview of a tool used for classification is made
and then it shows dataset's properties and statistics.

\sec Spectral View

Spectral View is web browser tool for classification of Ondřejov CCD700
spectral archive.
It was implemented to support creation of dataset for this work.
It is written in Python using
Tornado Web Framework\urlnote{http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/}
and Motor\urlnote{https://motor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/}
which is asynchronous driver for MongoDB.
Vizualizations are created with D3.js\urlnote{https://d3js.org/}.
Source code is available on
GitHub\urlnote{https://github.com/podondra/spectralview}.
and documentation is available on
Read the Docs\urlnote{http://spectralview.readthedocs.io/}.

Spectra are divided into emission, absorption, double-peak and unknown
classes according to spectral line at H$\alpha$ (see figure~\ref[classes]).

Data import is done through
a SSAP Service\urlnote{http://www.ivoa.net/documents/SSA/}.
These spectra are then split into corresponding classes by a user
who is presented with vizualization of full spectrum,
zoomed H$\alpha$ spectal line and
denoised respectively Gaussian convolved H$\alpha$.
Classified spectra can be viewed and move between classes on demand.

\sec Ondřejov Dataset

The resulting dataset consists of 13335 spectra.
Structure of this dataset is shown in~table~\ref[dataset-table].
Emission and absorption spectra are the most significant part of this dataset.
There are 6104 spectra with absoption line ins H$\alpha$
and 5300 with emission line.
But there are also 1534 spectra with double-peak in H$\alpha$
plus 397 spectra which cannot be easily classified.

All spectra in this dataset contain H$\alpha$
but they have different wavelength starts and ends.
Infimum form all wavelength starts is 6518.4272\,{\AA}.
and supremum from all wavelength ends is 6732.7432\,{\AA}.
There is on average one measurement of flux each 0.249\,{\AA}
with small standard deviation 0.0119\,{\AA}.
