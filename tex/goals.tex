\chap Goals

Primary goal of this bachelor thesis is to identify emission-line
Be stars in the LAMOST spectral survey archive
using deep neural networks trained on data from the Ondřejov archive.

Purpose of theorethical part is to introduce spectal data,
astronomical spectroscopy and electromagnetic radiation.
The properties of Ondřejov and LAMOST archives will be
described together with related techical concepts.
Next, this work should make survey of current state of deep neural networks
and overview of available deep learning
frameworks with analysis of suitability for spectral classification
and deployment on GPUs.

Practical part aims to create reasonable dataset from Ondřejov archive,
design deep neural network
and implement pipeline which will classify spectra from LAMOST archive.
