\secc Dataset Split

This section shows how the Ond≈ôejov dataset is split into
training, validation and test set.
These sets are required for training, tuning and evaluating any neural network.
All split are done as stratified sampling so that the distribution of
samples' number in a class is kept across sets.

Test set on which the neural network is evaluated contains 10\% of all data.
Validation set which serves for hyperparameter and architecture optimization
is 20\% of remaining data.
Training set is composed from the rest of data
and its purpose is for training the network's weights contains 80\% of all data.
Exact numbers of spectra in each set is in table~\ref[dataset-split-table].
