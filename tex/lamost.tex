\chap LAMOST Classification

In this chapter all knowledge from previous chapters is gathered
and used to classify LAMOST data release 1
which contains spectra from pilot and first year surveys
(see table~\ref[lamost]).
Firstly, architecture and training of a deep neural network is described
followed by evaluation and visualizations of results.

\sec Neural Network Architecture

A feedforward neural network and a convolutional neural network were design.
After evaluation on test set the convolutional network
was chosen for final classification.

Design choices follow guide provided by \cite[cs231n].
The main idea is to build rather deeper neural network
which has a lot of representation power
and use dropout (see section~\ref[dropout]) to avoid overfitting.
Next sections describe dropout and architectures.

\label[dropout]
\secc Dropout

{\bf Dropout} is technique for addressing problem of {\bf overfitting}.
The key idea is to randomly drop units from the neural network
during training.
Dropout created different smaller networks by blocking units of a big network.
This prevents units from co-adaption
and at test time the neural network with all units but smaller weights
is average of all the smaller networks from training.
\cite[dropout]

\secc Feedforward Network

The feedforward network has input layer with 140 units.
Then there are 5 hidden layers with 512 units
and the last output layer has 3 units
with softmax activation function~\cite[nielsen2015]
because there are 3 target classes.

Every hidden layer's activation function is \glref{ReLU}
(see section \ref[convnets]).
During training dropout (see subsection \ref[dropout]) is applied
with a unit dropout probability set to 0.5 as recommended by \cite[dropout].

\secc Convolutional Network

Architecture of convolutional network for spectra classification in this work
is inspired primarily by
VGGNet \cite[vggnet], AlexNet \cite[alexnet] and ZFNet \cite[zfnet].
These networks are design to process three dimensional images
counting \glref{RGB} color channels.
Spectrum can be understood as one dimensional image.
Therefore the architecture needs to be suited to this difference.

Sketch of architecture diagram is in figure~\ref[convnet].
The input layer has 140 units
and output layer has 3 units with softmax activation~\cite[nielsen2015].
In the middle there are convolutional layers
all with filter size 3 pixels and no padding.
First 2 layers have 64 of the filters.
Second 2 layers have 128 of them and the last 2 layers have 256 filters.
After each pair of convolutional layers is a max-pooling layers
of size 2 pixel with stride 2.
The last max-pooling layer is followed are 2 fully-connected layer
with 512 units each
and dropout with probability 0.5 \cite[dropout] applied in training.
All hidden layers use \glref{ReLU} activation function.

Convolutional layers are mark as {\tt conv3}
where the number 3 means the size of filter in pixels.
The mark is followed by dash and a number which specifies count of filters.
{\tt maxpool2} are max-pooling layers with pool size 2, stride 2 and no padding.
Fully-connected layer with 512 units are {\tt fc-512}
and {\tt softmax} is the output layer.

\sec Training Details

The process of babysitting the neural network training is described
in this section.
Dataset split and balancing is introduced.
Then the hyperparameters of training the network are described.
Lastly the networks' performance is evaluated.

\secc Dataset Split

This subsection shows how the Ond≈ôejov dataset is split into
training, validation and test set.
These sets are required for training, tuning and evaluating any neural network.
All split are done as stratified sampling so that the distribution of
samples' number in a class is kept across sets.

Test set on which neural networks are evaluated contains 10\% of all data.
Validation set which serves for hyperparameter and architecture optimization
is 20\% of remaining data.
Training set is composed from the rest of data
and its purpose is for training networks' weights.
Exact numbers of spectra in each set is in table~\ref[dataset-split-table].

\midinsert \clabel[dataset-split-table]{Dataset split table}

}
\caption/t Exact numbers of samples in train, validation and test set
divided according to emission, absorption and double-peak classes.

\secc SMOTE Balancing

\glref{SMOTE} is shortcut for
{\bf Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique}.
It is over-sampling approach in which the minority class is
over-sampled by creating {\bf synthetic} samples.
A new sample is created along line from a sample to its all or any $k$
nearest neighbors from same class.
Difference between feature vectors of sample under consideration
and nearest neighbor is taken.
It is multiply by random number between 0 and 1.
Finally it is added to the sample.
\cite[smote]

In this thesis \glref{SMOTE} balancing is used to balance training set
because the absorption class which can be considered as normal class
has the biggest number of samples while the emission and double-peak
classes has significantly less samples.
Emission and double-peak spectra which are the abnormal behaviors
then tend to be discriminated by the neural network.

Confusion matrix~\ref[imbalanced-cm] is proof of this.
The matrix shows 92\% accuracy on double-peak spectra
of the feedforward neural network on imbalanced dataset.
In contrast to 94\% accuracy when training on \glref{SMOTE} balanced dataset
(see confusion matrix on the left in figure~\ref[confusion-matrices]).

\midinsert \clabel[imbalanced-cm]{Imbalanced confusion matrix}
\picw=10cm \cinspic img/imbalanced-cm.png
\caption/f Confusion matrix evaluated on validation set

\endinsert

In this work implementation of \glref{SMOTE}
from Scikit-learn contribution Python package
{\bf imbalanced-learn} \cite[imblearn] in version 0.2.1 is used:

\begtt
import imblearn.over_sampling

N_CLASSES = 3
smote = imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE()
for _ in range(N_CLASSES - 1):
    X, y = smote.fit_sample(X, y)
\endtt

where {\tt X} is input and also output matrix with training data
and {\tt y} is vector of corresponding labels.

\secc Training Setting

Training a neural networks is an optimization problem.
The function to optimize is {\bf categorical cross-entropy} loss function
(see online book~\cite[nielsen2015]).

To optimize to the loss function {\bf Adam} optimizer is used.
It is an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization
of stochastic objective functions.
Parameters are set to values recommended by its paper
(learning rate $\alpha = 0.001$,
decay rates $\beta_1 = 0.9$ and $\beta_2 = 0.999$,
fuzz factor $\epsilon = 10^{-8}$).
These are also the defaults in Keras implementation
which is available in TensorFlow.
\cite[adam]

Figure~\ref[convnet-training] shows the \glref{CNN}'s progress
of accuracy and loss over 250 epochs
(the training set was presented to the network for learning 250 times).
The increase of accuracy is fast and training and validation accuracies
are close to each other so there is little overfitting.

\midinsert \clabel[convnet-training]{Training accuracy and loss}

\caption/f Convolutional network training statistics during 250 epochs
with batch size 256. The top plot shows training and validation accuracy
and the bottom plot shows decrease of loss.
\endinsert

In TensorFlow this implements code:

\begtt
import tensorflow.contrib.keras as keras

model = keras.models.Sequential([
    # definition of neural network
])
model.compile(
    loss='categorical_crossentropy',
    optimizer='adam',
    metrics=['accuracy']
)
model.fit(
    X_train, y_train_one_hot, epochs=250, batch_size=256
    validation_data=(X_validation, y_validation_one_hot)
)
\endtt

where {\tt X\_train} and {\tt X\_validation} are matrices with spectral data,
{\tt y\_train\_one\_hot} and {\tt y\_validation\_one\_hot}
are classes one hot matrices.

\secc Evaluation

Networks are evaluated on the test set.
From confusion matrices in figure~\ref[confusion-matrices] is clear that
convolutional network perform slightly better.
\glref{CNN} predicted correctly 99\% of emission spectra while the feedforward
network only 98\%.
Both predicted 99\% of absorptions correctly.
In double-peak spectra prediction convolutional network has accuracy 95\%
and feedforward network 94\%.
Thus convolutional neural network is chosen for classification
of spectra from \glref{LAMOST}.

\sec Performance and Scalability

Recent advance in deep neural network research would not be possible
without performance improvement of general purpose \glref{GPU}s. \cite[alexnet]
This thesis makes similar observation.
The convolutional network was experimentally
trained on \glref{GPU} GeForce GTX 980 and two Intel Xeon \glref{CPU}s.
The GeForce GTX
980\urlnote{http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-980}
has 2\,048 \glref{CUDA} cores and 4\,GB of memory.
The two Intel Xeon \glref{CPUs}
E5-2403\urlnote{http://ark.intel.com/products/64615/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-2403-10M-Cache-1_80-GHz-6_40-GTs-Intel-QPI}
has 8 cores in total and 24\,GB of available \glref{RAM}.
Results are presented in table~\ref[performance-table].

\midinsert \clabel[performance-table]{GPU vs CPU performance}

}
\caption/t Comparison of training convolutional neural network
on \glref{GPU} and \glref{CPU}.
The training is done on whole Ond≈ôejov dataset,
number of epochs is 100 and batch size is 256.
In terms of wall time (elapsed real time) there \glref{GPU}
is roughly 27 times faster.
\endinsert

Table~\ref[performance-table] confirms the need of \glref{GPU}
computational power for deep neural networks training.
Training on \glref{GPU} is 27 times faster than on \glref{CPU}.
For large networks there might be memory problems on \glref{GPU}
but the net design in this thesis does not require a lot of memory.
Moreover TensorFlow support distributed computation so the whole system
may scale to more \glref{GPU} cards on demand. \cite[tensorflow]

\sec Results and Visualizations

For the final classification the convolutional network
(diagram~\ref[convnet]) is trained on whole Ond≈ôejov dataset.
The training was stopped after {\bf 229 epochs}
with {\bf 99.96\%} accuracy on training set and lasted only
{\bf 8 minutes 21 seconds}.

Prediction of {\bf 2\,202\,000 spectra} from \glref{LAMOST} data release 1
has taken {\bf 1 minute 36 seconds}.
The spectra are interpolated to same grid as spectra Ond≈ôejov dataset
(see section~\ref[regridding]) and standardized (see section~\ref[scaling]).
The number of spectra classified into the classes is
in~table~\ref[prediction-table].

\midinsert \clabel[prediction-table]{LAMOST predictions}
\ctable{lr}{
    \hfil class & number of spectra \hfil \crl \tskip4pt
    emission    &    158\,115             \cr
    absorption  & 1\,898\,095             \cr
    double-peak &    145\,790             \cr
}
\caption/t Counts of \glref{LAMOST} spectra split

\endinsert

The table~\ref[prediction-table] shows that the convolutional network
reduced the number of possibly interesting object (emission or double-peak)
from 2\,202\,000 to 303\,905.
That is about 14\% from whole \glref{LAMOST} data release 1.
While visualizing spectra according to predicted classes
good representatives can be found.
Figures~\ref[lamost-emission] and \ref[lamost-double-peak] show examples
of correctly classified spectra from the interesting emission and
double-peak classes.
But there are also noisy spectra of different kinds mix up with
good class candidates.
Especially in double-peak class where the noise near to absorption line
in often incorrectly consider as double-peak.

\endinsert

This imperfection of the deep convolutional classifier is probably caused
by insufficient training set.
The Ond≈ôejov dataset and Ond≈ôejov archive in general
is composed of not noisy well captured spectra.
Therefore the neural network is not trained to recognize noisy or damaged
spectra and put them apart.
It has to predict them as one of the three classes.

Principal component analysis of \glref{LAMOST} data space
in~figure~\ref[pca-lamost] also proofs the Ond≈ôejov dataset limitation.
Although the points from Ond≈ôejov dataset used during training cover most
of the \glref{LAMOST} data there are some areas
where the dataset has no points at all.
These are probably the points were the classifier misjudge spectra
because it has no prior knowledge about them.

To overcome this problem either
a method which can filter the noisy spectra out should be used
or the dataset should be extended with new class
where should the classifier put noisy spectra.
