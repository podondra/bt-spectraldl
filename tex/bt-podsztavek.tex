    Large astronomical archives, as for example LAMOST spectral archive,
    contain plenty of hidden information. Deep learning is one of the most
    popular method used nowadays to gain knowledge from this kind of data.
    This work shows the process of finding emission-line spectra in
    LAMOST archive using deep neural network trained on data from Ondřejov 2m
    telescope. Overview of several techniques is presented. These include
    preprocessing of spectra, adaptation of Ondřejov data to LAMOST resolution,
    dimensionality reduction, data visualization, architecture and training of
    a deep neural network. Finally, discovered objects with interesting
    physical nature deserving further detailed analysis are discussed.
