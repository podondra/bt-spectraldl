\chap Spectral Data

This thesis is concerned with classification of star's spectra.
Aim of this chapter is to describe these spectral data.
The following sections introduce spectrography,
astronomical archives of the data and related concepts.

\sec Astronomical Spectroscopy

Spectroscopy studies the properties of matter through its interaction with
different frequency components of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Astronomical spectroscopy is measuring the spectrum of electromagnetic
radiation of hot celestial objects.
This information is then used to derive for example chemical composition,
temperature, distance or relative motion.

\sec FITS File Format

Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) is standard data format used in
astronomy. It is used to transport not only image data but also
astronomical spectra, data cubes, table and header with keywords providing
descriptive information about the data. \cite[fits-support-office]

\sec VOTable Data Format

Focus on XML and metadata.
Easy serialization to FITS file formatl.

\sec SSAP

Shortcut fo Simple Spectral Access Protocol.
Mention serialization and datalink.
