\chap Machine Learning

Machine learning is subfield of artificial intelligence \cite[russell10].
Algorithms in machine learning allow computer programs to learn from data
\cite[goodfellow16].
Samuel Arthur proposed this famous statement about machine learning in
\cite[samuel95]:
``{\em Programming computers to learn from experience should eventually
eliminate the need for much of this programming effort.}''
Formal and widely used definition is provided by Tom Mitchell in
\cite[mitchell97]:
``{\em A computer program is said to learn from
experience $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$ and performance measure
$P$, if its performance at tasks in $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with
experience $E$.}''.

Therefore, instead of hardcoding the desired model directly into program,
data are feeded into machine learning algorithm which develops its own model.
This is called {\bf data-driven approach} since it depends on providing the
algorithm with vast amount of data. \cite[cs231n]

For example, considering the image classification program. It would be
challenging to hardcode into program how general dog looks. Machine learning
algorithm in combination with data-driven approach would take large collection
of dog's images, feed them into program and let it develop its own
notion of what a dog looks like.

Commonly, machine learning is divided into {\bf supervised} and
{\bf unsupervised} learning.
In supervised learning, there is a data set and its corresponding output values.
Supervised algorithms are used for solving {\bf classification} or
{\bf regression} tasks.
In classification inputs are assigned from a set of discrete values.
On contrary, regression predicts ouputs from continuos range.
Unsupervised learning allows to solve problems where is no or little idea about
the result. \cite[goodfellow16]

This work is focused on application of deep neural network is astronomy.
Deep neural networks are one of many machine learning algorithms.
Next sections make overview of neural networks and deep learning.

\sec Deep Learning

Machine learning offers varied range of approaches.
One of them is deep learning which tries to build these concepts from
hierarchy of many simple concepts and because this graph is deep this
approach is called deep learning \cite[goodfellow16].

This concept of representing complicated structure in terms of other simpler
representation is main feature of deep learning, which distinguish it from other
branches of machine learning \cite[goodfellow16].
Deep learning algorithm can recognize images by firstly identifying corners
then building contours from them and finally construct the whole object.
It is extremely difficult to go from raw pixel data straight to the object
in image recognition.
